# TikTok Bot Dashboard - AI Development Guide

This document provides guidance on how to effectively use the milestone structure for iterative development of the TikTok Bot Dashboard project with AI assistance.

## How to Use This Milestone Structure

The milestone structure in `milestones.md` is designed to facilitate an iterative development approach with AI assistants. Here's how to effectively use it:

### 1. Focus on One Milestone at a Time

- Work through milestones sequentially, as each builds upon the previous
- Complete all deliverables for a milestone before moving to the next
- Use the milestone goal as your primary focus for each development session

### 2. Session-Based Development

For each milestone:

1. **Initial Session**: Begin with planning and setup tasks
   - Review the milestone goal and deliverables
   - Set up necessary infrastructure
   - Create skeleton code and structures

2. **Development Sessions**: Focus on implementing specific tasks
   - Select 3-5 related tasks per session
   - Implement functionality incrementally
   - Test each component as it's developed

3. **Review Session**: Evaluate against success criteria
   - Verify all tasks are complete
   - Test against success criteria
   - Address any issues before proceeding

### 3. Effective AI Collaboration

- **Clear Instructions**: Begin each session with specific goals from the milestone
- **Context Sharing**: Provide the AI with relevant code and progress from previous sessions
- **Incremental Requests**: Break down complex tasks into smaller requests
- **Review & Refine**: Regularly review AI-generated code and refine as needed

### 4. Documentation Throughout

- Document code as it's developed
- Update README and other documentation with each milestone
- Keep track of design decisions and architecture changes

### 5. Testing at Every Stage

- Write tests alongside feature development
- Verify functionality against success criteria
- Regression test previous milestone features

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Manageable Scope**: Each milestone has a clear, limited scope
- **Visible Progress**: Concrete deliverables show advancement
- **Quality Control**: Regular review points ensure quality
- **Flexibility**: Easier to adjust direction between milestones
- **Reduced Complexity**: Focus on specific aspects in each session

## Example Session Structure

### Example: First Session for Milestone 1

1. **Instruction to AI**:
   "Let's begin implementing Milestone 1: Project Foundation & Basic Account Management. Today we'll focus on setting up the project repository and development environment."

2. **Specific Tasks**:
   - Create project repository with README
   - Set up development environment (Node.js, React, MongoDB)
   - Define project structure (folders, modules)

3. **Review**:
   Evaluate the implementation against the relevant success criteria:
   - Repository is properly structured with documentation
   - Development environment runs without errors

### Example: Follow-up Session

1. **Context Sharing**:
   "We've set up the project structure and environment. Now let's implement the database schema and basic account operations."

2. **Specific Tasks**:
   - Design database schema for account storage
   - Set up Node.js/Express server
   - Implement database connection

3. **Review**:
   Test the implementation and verify database connectivity.

## Milestone Transition Checklist

Before moving to the next milestone:

- [ ] All tasks for current milestone are complete
- [ ] All success criteria have been met
- [ ] Code has been reviewed and refactored if needed
- [ ] Tests are passing
- [ ] Documentation is up-to-date
- [ ] Any issues or bugs have been addressed

By following this structured approach, you'll be able to effectively develop the TikTok Bot Dashboard through iterative sessions with AI assistance, maintaining quality and making steady progress throughout the project.
