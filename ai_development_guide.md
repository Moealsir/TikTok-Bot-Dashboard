# TikTok Bot Dashboard - AI Development Approach

This document provides guidance on how to effectively use the revised milestone structure for iterative development of the TikTok Bot Dashboard project with AI assistance.

## Benefits of the Revised Milestone Structure

The revised milestone structure offers several key advantages for AI-assisted development:

1. **Manageable Scope**: Each milestone has been broken down into smaller, more focused sub-milestones that are achievable within a single development session with AI.

2. **Clear Progression**: The A-B-C structure within each milestone number provides a logical progression path while maintaining flexibility.

3. **Frequent Completion Points**: Smaller milestones mean more frequent completion points, providing better visibility of progress and more opportunities for review.

4. **Reduced Complexity**: Each sub-milestone focuses on a specific aspect of functionality, making it easier to explain requirements to AI assistants.

5. **Better Dependency Management**: More granular dependencies allow for more flexible development paths and easier tracking of prerequisites.

## How to Use This Structure with AI

### Session Planning

1. **Select an Appropriate Sub-Milestone**: Choose a single sub-milestone (e.g., 1A, 2B, 3C) for each development session with AI.

2. **Verify Dependencies**: Ensure all dependency milestones have been completed before starting.

3. **Prepare Context**: Gather relevant code, documentation, and requirements from previous milestones to provide context.

### During AI Sessions

1. **Clear Goal Setting**: Begin each session by clearly stating the sub-milestone goal and specific deliverables.

2. **Task Focus**: Focus on 2-3 tasks from the milestone in each interaction with the AI.

3. **Incremental Progress**: Build functionality incrementally, testing each component as it's developed.

4. **Regular Checkpoints**: Periodically review progress against the success criteria during the session.

### Between Sessions

1. **Review Completion**: Verify all tasks and success criteria have been met before marking a sub-milestone as complete.

2. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect completed work and decisions made.

3. **Code Review**: Review and refine AI-generated code to ensure quality and consistency.

4. **Plan Next Steps**: Identify the next logical sub-milestone based on dependencies and project priorities.

## Example Development Path

Here's an example of how you might progress through the early milestones:

1. Complete Milestone 1A (Project Setup & Environment)
2. Complete Milestone 1B (Database & Server Setup)
3. Complete Milestone 1C (Frontend Foundation)
4. Complete Milestone 2A (Account Management Backend)
5. Complete Milestone 2B (Account Management Frontend)

Then you could choose either:
- Milestone 3A (TikTok Session Management)
- Milestone 3B (Hashtag Management)

This flexibility allows you to prioritize based on your specific needs while ensuring dependencies are met.

## Milestone Transition Checklist

Before considering a sub-milestone complete:

- [ ] All tasks for the sub-milestone are implemented
- [ ] All success criteria have been met and verified
- [ ] Code has been reviewed and refined
- [ ] Tests are in place and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Any issues or bugs have been addressed

By following this structured approach with the revised milestones, you'll be able to effectively develop the TikTok Bot Dashboard through focused, manageable sessions with AI assistance.
